This is a social network project for CS50 Web programming course. The project is developed using Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Project Description

    Create new text-based posts.
    Display all posts from all users with the most recent posts first.
    Display the profile page of a user with the number of followers and followed users and all posts for that user, in reverse chronological order. The profile page should also allow users to follow or unfollow other users.
    Display posts made by the users that the current user follows.
